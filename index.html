    <h1 style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#43302E">About me</h1>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#786D5F">Hi! I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Houston. As a remote sensing data scientist, my interest is to apply remotely sensed data</p>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#786D5F">for disaster prevention, early risk assessment and to help the authorities to do meaningful decision making.</p>
      
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#786D5F">My current research focuses on using satellite altimetry, optical and radar (SAR) imagery, hydrological model, and machine learning technique</p>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#786D5F">to perform flood forecasting. I have been working on a NASA-funded Project, called <a href="https://servirglobal.net/" style="text-decoration:none; font-weight:bold; color:#493D26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SERVIR</a>, with study area over the Southeast Asia. The objective is to help</p>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#786D5F">data-sparse developing countries build sustainable and independent capacity for early flood risk assessment. I have developed a flood water level</p>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#786D5F">and a spatial inundation forecasting systems. I have also delievered several training activities to the local stakeholders, for them to learn our</p>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#786D5F">techniques. I am also working on a NOAA-funded Project, which I use optical imagery (VIIRS) to forecast areal water fraction in the U.S.</p>
